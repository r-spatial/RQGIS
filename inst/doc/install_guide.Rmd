# Vignette info
This vignette guides you through the installation process of QGIS, GRASS- and SAGA-GIS on three different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux). Following our instructions should ensure that RQGIS will work properly. With the exception of SAGA, we recommend to use the latest stable version of all software packages. Though other versions might also work with RQGIS, we did not test this.

Overall, RQGIS allows access to more than 1000 geoalgorithms. However, please note that the number of geoalgorithms you can use from within RQGIS depends on the platform, the system architecture, the selection of installed third-party providers and software package versions.

# Windows

There are at least two options to install QGIS on Windows in such a way that RQGIS can access QGIS. The first option is the Standalone Installer from the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). This will install QGIS along with the third-party providers GRASS and SAGA. However, if you would like to use even more third-party providers (e.g., GDAL, GEOS, Taudem, OTB, PostGIS, etc.), we recommend to use the OSGeo4W Network installer. This installer is available on the [QGIS installer page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) as well as on the [OSGeo4W-website](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). 

To install OSGeo4W, the easiest way is to to use the Express installation:

<center>
  <img src="00_express.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

We are sorry, that our installer uses a German dialog. Apparently, OSGeo4w automatically uses the language in accordance with the IP-address. Nevertheless, it should be easy enough to follow our steps.

1. Select "Express Installation" 
2. Next check "QGIS, GRASS and GDAL"
3. Start the installation.

This installation is more or less equivalent to the standalone QGIS-installation. However, to have the full choice of available geoalgorithms provided by QGIS, we recommend to use the  advanced settings of the OSGeo4W Network installer:

1. Run the OSGeo4W setup and choose the advanced installation. 

<center>
  <img src="01_initial_setup.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>


2. Subsequently, accept the default settings until you reach the “Select Packages” window.

<center>
  <img src="04_select_packages.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

3. After expanding the command line utilities, we choose several commandline tools such as gdal and python-core (of course, you can select other components as well):

<center>
  <img src="05_command_line_utilties.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Additionally, we choose the Desktop-GIS GRASS 6 & 7, the Orfeo Toolbox, SAGA, and of course QGIS. Here, we install both the most recent QGIS version as well as the long-term release. RQGIS will use the latter by default since this is the most stable version and everything is already set up correctly. By contrast, using QGIS 2.16.1 would require some additional code adjustment (see above).

<center>
  <img src="06_desktop_gis.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

4. We leave the rest as is, click "Next" and wait for the OSGeo4W-suggestions which we accept.

<center>
  <img src="08_suggestions.PNG" width="50%" height="50%">
</center>

Clicking "Next" once more will start the download and installation process which might take a while.

If you wish to to modify, uninstall or update some of the installed components, you might do so later on by running `../OSGeo4W/bin/osgeo4w-setup.exe`. Alternatively, you can download and run again the latest [OSGeo4W-executable](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/).

If you additionally want to use the **LiDAR processing tools** (LAStools), please follow the steps found [here](https://rapidlasso.com/2013/09/29/how-to-install-lastools-toolbox-in-qgis/).

# Mac OS X

**NOTE**  
Since there is no OSGEO like installer available for OS X, linking problems between different software installations (QGIS, RQGIS, SAGA etc.) might occur. To avoid/reduce such problems, we recommend to do all installations using the package management system "homebrew". This ensures correct linking between all softwares. Furthermore, this is the way we check RQGIS compatibility for OS X. Hence, more precise help can be given if problems might occur using this installation way. 

## QGIS

Recently, Homebrew also supports [GUI installations](https://caskroom.github.io/). QGIS can be installed using `brew cask install qgis` from the command line if homebrew is installed and configured correctly. 

[Follow this link](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) for the binary installation. Please make sure to also install GDAL separately, preferably following [this link](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks) or using your own package manager (Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts). Note that problems might occur mixing up the binary QGIS installation and framework installations from package managers. 

## GRASS
If you install QGIS 2.16 on your system using `brew cask install qgis`, GRASS7 will work out-of-the-box within QGIS. 
GRASS6 algorithms are deprecated and do not work anymore in QGIS 2.16 (see this [link](http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/205964/43409)).

Right now, problems linking GRASS6/7 in QGIS 2.14.x might occur. 

Other methods installing GRASS versions are listed here:

* The binary GRASS installation can be found [here](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/mac-osx/). 

* If you use homebrew, please see [this guide](https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Compiling_on_MacOSX_using_homebrew) to install GRASS 7x on your system. 
Right now, some problems might occur trying to link standalone GRASS7 installations and QGIS.


## SAGA
QGIS for Mac comes with a preconfigured SAGA installation and should work out of the box.  

Custom SAGA installations: Using homebrew, SAGA can be installed via `brew install saga-gis`.  

There is no binary install of SAGA for Mac. Therefore the "homebrew-way" is recommended. Alternatively, you can compile SAGA from source from the [SAGA website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/files/). Make sure to check RQGIS compatibility with your SAGA version! You can do this using `qgis_session_info()` in RQGIS.

To compile a custom installation of SAGA with QGIS, follow these steps:

1. Open the following file in your QGIS installation: (.../python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/SagaUtils.py)
2. In the function `findSagaFolder()` change the path setting pointing to the folder containing `saga_cmd`:

```py
testfolder = os.path.join(QgsApplication.prefixPath(), 'bin')
```

For homebrew installations (always located under "/usr/local/Cellar") a working setup would look like this:

```py
# testfolder = os.path.join(QgsApplication.prefixPath(), 'bin')
testfolder = '/usr/local/Cellar/saga-gis/2.2.2/bin'
```

After restarting QGIS, you should recognize the change of the SAGA version under "Processing->Toolbox". 



# Linux

## QGIS (and GRASS)
If you install QGIS with the built-in software managers, you will most likely get an outdated QGIS version. To install more recent QGIS releases, we recommend to follow the installation instructions from the [QGIS installers website](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html). 

Here, we just describe exemplarily the QGIS installation procedure under Debian/Ubuntu following the description found [here](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu). RQGIS should work as well with Linux derivatives other than Ubuntu. However, we did not test this.

Open a terminal window. First of all, make sure to remove QGIS and GRASS packages you may have installed before from other repositories:

<!--http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/167472/qgis-2-8-ubuntu-14-04-installation-issues-terminal-command-attempts-to-install-->
```sh 
sudo apt-get --purge remove qgis
sudo apt autoremove --purge remove 
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt-get update
```

Next add the correct repository to sources.list. Here, we use the QGIS long-term release (2.14) (for QGIS 2.16, we would have to use http://qgis.org/ubuntugis instead of http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr):

```sh
# add QGIS repository for Ubuntu 16.04 to sources.list
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr xenial main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb-src http://qgis.org/ubuntugis-ltr xenial main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu xenial main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
```
For Ubuntu 14.04 simply replace xenial by trusty. 

After that, we can install QGIS and GRASS as follows:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

If this results in keyserver errors, add the qgis.org repository public key to your apt keyring:

```sh
wget -O - http://qgis.org/downloads/qgis-2015.gpg.key | gpg --import
# to verify, run:
# gpg --fingerprint 3FF5FFCAD71472C4
gpg --export --armor 3FF5FFCAD71472C4 | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

This will install the QGIS 2.14 release (LTR) as well as GRASS-GIS as third-party provider. 

## SAGA
<!---
To use SAGA functions within (R)QGIS, you naturally need to install SAGA GIS. To install the most recent SAGA version, simply execute the following lines in a terminal window: 

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:johanvdw/saga-gis  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install saga
```
sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:johanvdw/saga-gis
--->

Unfortunately, QGIS does not support the latest SAGA versions. To find out which SAGA versions are supported by your QGIS installation, run:

```{r saga, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library("RQGIS")
info <- qgis_session_info()
info$supported_saga_versions
```

This also means we cannot simply use a package manager to install SAGA. Instead we need to compile one of the SAGA versions, QGIS supports. Using one of those versions, automatically will add SAGA to the processing toolbox of QGIS (this might not be true for SAGA >= 2.2.1 see further below). Prior to the SAGA installation, we need to install various dependencies required by SAGA. Here, we just quickly show how to install SAGA and its dependencies under Ubuntu. Please refer to [https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20a%20Linux%20Unicode%20version/](https://sourceforge.net/p/saga-gis/wiki/Compiling%20a%20Linux%20Unicode%20version/) for a more comprehensive SAGA installation guide. Please note that we simply present in great parts a copy of this guide here.

First of all, install all necessary SAGA dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev libtiff4-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libjasper-dev libexpat1-dev wx-common libexpat1-dev libogdi3.2-dev proj unixodbc-dev

sudo apt-get install g++ make automake libtool subversion
```

<!---
First option:

1. Donwload the SAGA-version you would like to a folder you have access to (e.g.)
mkdir /home/jannes/saga-svn
2. Unzip/unpack SAGA in this folder
3. open the terminal and change the directory to the SAGA folder
```sh
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install
saga_gui
export SAGA_MLB=/usr/local/lib/saga
saga_cmd
```
--->

Secondly, create a folder named `saga-svn` (e.g., in your home directory) to which you would like to download SAGA. Next, change to this folder and specifiy the SAGA release you would like to install (here: 2.2.0) by checking the corresponding branch. Changing the directory again to ~/saga-svn/release-2-2-0/saga-gis, finally sets you up for the SAGA compilation. The compilation installs SAGA to `/usr/local/lib`. 

```sh
mkdir ~/saga-svn
cd ~/saga-svn
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/saga-gis/code-0/branches/release-2-2-0
cd ~/saga-svn/release-2-2-0/saga-gis
sudo autoreconf -i
sudo ./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```

To check if SAGA was successfully compiled, run:

```
saga_cmd
saga_gui
```

Sometimes `saga_gui` produces following error message:

```sh
saga_gui: error while loading shared libraries: libsaga_gdi-2.2.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
In this case, you have to enable the SAGA GUI by specifying the path where `libsaga_gdi-2.2.0.so` is located:
```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
saga_gui
```

Using SAGA >= 2.2.1 you might encounter following message in the Processing log when opening QGIS: `Problem with SAGA installation: installed SAGA version (2.2.1) is not supported`. Though in this case SAGA is not available in the processing toolbox, you are still able to use it via the QGIS Python API and therefore also with RQGIS.

In case you would like to uninstall SAGA, type:

```sh
cd ~/saga-svn/release-2-2-0/saga-gis
sudo make uninstall
```

## Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)
You can download the Orfeo Toolbox from [here](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download/). We save the .run-script to the Desktop. Of course, you might select any other accesible folder. Next, we create a folder named "Applications" to which we move the .run script. Finally, we install OTB. Please note that so far there is only a **64-bit** OTB version available. This version does not work on 32-bit machines!

```sh
mkdir /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/
mv /home/<YourUserName>/Desktop/<filename> /home/<YourUserName>/Applications
sh /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<NameOfScript>
```
(R)QGIS assumes that the "OTB applications folder" is located at "/usr/lib/otb/applications" (see also [QGIS manual](https://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/user_manual/processing/3rdParty.html#orfeo-toolbox)). Therefore, we need to move the OTB installation to the corresponding folder: 

```sh
# move applications folder
sudo mv /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/lib/otb /usr/lib/
# commandline tools
cp -a /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/<YourOTBInstallation>/bin/. /usr/bin
```
OTB algorithms should be now availabe in the "Processing Toolbox" and in RQGIS (use `find_algorithms()` to check). Finally, we clean up after ourselves by deleting the previously created Applications folder:

```sh
rmdir /home/<YourUserName>/Applications/
```
