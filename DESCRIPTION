Description: Establishes an interface between R and 'QGIS', i.e. it allows
    the user to access 'QGIS' functionalities from the R console. It achieves this
    by using the 'QGIS' Python API via the command line. Hence, RQGIS extends R's 
    statistical power by the incredible vast geo-functionality of 'QGIS' (including 
    also 'GDAL', 'SAGA'- and 'GRASS'-GIS among other third-party providers). This in turn 
    creates a powerful environment for advanced and innovative (geo-)statistical
    geocomputing. 'QGIS' is licensed under GPL version 2 or greater and is available from
    <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/>.
