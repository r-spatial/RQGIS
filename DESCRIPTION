Description: Establishes an interface between R and 'QGIS', i.e. it allows
    the user to access 'QGIS' functionalities from the R console. It achieves this
    by using the 'QGIS' Python API via the command line. Hence, RQGIS extends R's
    statistical power by the incredible vast geo-functionality of 'QGIS' (including
    also 'GDAL', 'SAGA'- and 'GRASS'-GIS among other third-party providers).
    This in turn creates a powerful environment for advanced and innovative
    (geo-)statistical geocomputing. 'QGIS' is licensed under GPL version 2 or
    greater and is available from <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/>.
