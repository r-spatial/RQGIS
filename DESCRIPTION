Description: Package RQGIS establishes an interface between R and QGIS, i.e. it allows
    the user to access QGIS functionalities from the R console. It achieves this
    by using the QGIS Python API via the command line. Hence, RQGIS extends R's 
    statistical power by the incredible vast geo-functionality of QGIS (including 
    also GDAL, SAGA- and GRASS-GIS among other third-party providers). This in turn 
    creates a powerful environment for advanced and innovative (geo-)statistical
    geocomputing.
